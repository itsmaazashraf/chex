# PROJECT INFORMATION

An AI-based car inspection platform, that helps companies like UBER, and ZOOM to speed up the process of registration (for their drivers).


# REQUIREMENTS

In order to have a vehicle inspected, you must visit a mechanic or schedule an appointment. In some cases, the appointment doesn't necessarily work out, or you are unable to make it on time to the mechanic and end up rescheduling. All of this takes a lot of time.
